# inventory for artists
## the problem
For many artists, managing a growing number of products—such as original artwork, prints, commissions, and merchandise—can quickly become overwhelming. Without a clear system for managing inventory, it's easy to lose track of availability, oversell items, or struggle to manage product variations. This disorganization not only causes stress and inefficiencies, but also takes time away from the creative process and can lead to missed sales opportunities.
